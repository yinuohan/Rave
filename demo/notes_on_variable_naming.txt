Here are a few points on how variable names in the code correspond to those in the paper.
Variables used to make up an observation (as opposed to fit an observation) usually have the suffix "_make".
Variables in all caps are typically lists that store the corresponding lower case variables from a for loop. 

* Rings and annuli mean the same thing and are used interchangeably. 
  - Paper: N
  - Code: n_rings, nrings

* Boundaries of annuli
  - Paper: R
  - Code: R_bounds

* A 1D flux profile is usually called a "linecut" in the code. 
  - Paper: full 1D flux (L); midplane flux (l); discretised full 1D flux (K_full); discretised midplane flux (K_mid)
  - Code: full/linecut; part; L/binned_linecut/all_binned_ring_linecut; l

* Region defining midplane
  - Paper: y_mid
  - Code: cut_height

* Surface brightness profile
  - Paper: surface brightness profile/radial profile
  - Code: weights/ratios when discrete, profile when continuous
